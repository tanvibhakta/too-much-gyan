    Moni with his pumpkin ritual and takes Moni in for a Nasa tour (Surreal ofcourse).
    \ To Moni the world of animal erotica and ever tossing roomate Zapak give a sense
    of belonging until the bell rings and  Nasa's girlfried Sony pops up asking them
    to clean up the mess they made . Nasa comforts his baby with his skills in no
    time and Monikanth is coaxed into attending a late night party by the couple.\n\n\n\n###
